# Overview

This is a simple "Pong" game that I created in Unity with C#. The game is simple, two players go head to head and try to hit the ball past their opponents paddle. Player 1 moves their paddle with the "W" and "S" keys and player 2 moves their paddle with the up and down arrow keys.

I created a few basic scripts for this game which allows the paddles to move, the ball to bounce and react to collisions, and collisions with side walls to reset the scene and update the score.

# Development Environment

I created this project using the Unity Engine and coded the scripts using C#. Physics were created by Unity's built in physics engine.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Transition the game from pong to a air hocky game with 2 dimensional movement.
* Add a computer that you can play against.
* Fix some bugs happening with the ball speed.
